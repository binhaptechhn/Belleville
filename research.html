                <p class="mb-5"><b>Objectives:</b>To investigate the association between oral hygiene behaviors
                    (toothbrushing, water rinsing after brushing, interproximal cleaning, and adjunctive use of fluoride
                    products) and recent caries (past 24 months) in a random sample of patients in Northwest PRECEDENT
                    practices.</p>

                <p class="mb-4"><b>Methods:</b>Practitioner-members of Northwest PRECEDENT dental Practice-based
                    Research
                    Network (PBRN) conducted a longitudinal study on caries risk assessment. At baseline patients
                    completed a questionnaire on oral self-care, snacking, health, and socio-demographics. A dental
                    exam recorded readily-visible heavy plaque and DMFT; chart review captured new caries and
                    treatments in the previous 24 months. Bivariate and multiple GEE log-linear regression models
                    stratified by age groups were used to relate oral hygiene behaviors to the primary outcome of
                    mean dental caries in the past 24 months on data from 1400 patients in 63 practices. The primary
                    exposure of interest was fluoride toothbrushing frequency. </p>
                <p class="mb-4-lg-7"><b>Results:</b>Fluoride brushing once daily or more in patients 9-17 was
                    significantly
                    associated with 50% lower mean caries rates than fluoride brushing less than once daily (Rate (RR) )
                    = 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.3-0.8). For patients 18-64 fluoride brushing twice or more
                    daily was significantly associated with a 40% lower mean recent caries rate (RR = 0.6; 95% CI =
                    0.4-0 ,9); in patients 65+, twice-daily fluoride brushing or more was not associated with lower
                    rates of caries (RR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.7-1.8). </p>

            <p class="mb-4-lg-7"><b>Conclusions:</b>In the present study, the frequency of fluoride toothbrushing and
                the presence of
                readily-visible heavy plaque were the factors most strongly associated with mean caries rate. In
                young patients with permanent dentition the daily application of fluoride toothpaste appears more
                important than emphasis on thorough plaque removal. While for adults, the protective effect of twice
                daily fluoride toothbrushing disappears with advancing age and the presence of readily-visible heavy
                plaque becomes increasingly associated with caries risk.</p>

                    knowledge and habits, and anthropometric index were investigated by the self-administered
                    questionnaire. Dental status including DT, MT, FT were examined. The multiple logistic regression
                    analysis was performed to explore factors that were associated with dental caries. </p>

                    emphasis on oral self-checked oral disease behaviors and normal weight maintenance are necessary to

                    miniscrew stability. We investigated stress distribution in two miniscrews with different thread
                    shapes (type A and B) and in cortical bone of three different thicknesses using three-dimensional
                    (3D) finite element (FE) models. More specifically, 3D FE models of two different miniscrews were
                    created and placed obliquely or vertically into a cylindrical bone model representing different
                    cortical bone thicknesses. When force was applied to the miniscrew, the stress distribution on the
                    screw surface and in the peri-implant bone was assessed using FE methodology. Miniscrew safety was
                    evaluated using a modified Soderberg safety factor. Screw head displacement increased with a
                    decrease in cortical bone thickness, irrespective of screw type. The smallest minimum principal
                    stresses on the screw surfaces remained constant in type A miniscrews on changes in cortical bone
                    thickness. Minimum principal stresses also appeared on the cortical bone surface. Lower absolute
                    values of minimum principal stresses were seen in type A miniscrews when placed vertically and with
                    upward traction in obliquely placed type B miniscrews. Both miniscrews had acceptable safety factor
                    values. Taken together, orthodontists should select and use the suitable miniscrew for each patient
                    in consideration of bone properties. </p>

                <p class="mb-4"><b>Methods:</b>In the present study, we adopted two different titanium miniscrews with
                    the same screw length and diameter: type A (AbsoAnchor, SH1615-07; Dentos Ltd., Daegu, South Korea)
                    and type B (B-max Screw, Type-TK; BIODENT Co., Tokyo, Japan) miniscrews. Both miniscrews were made
                    of titanium alloy (6AL-4V ELI) and had a screw length of 7.0 mm and a screw diameter of 1.6 mm. The
                    yield stress of the titanium alloy was reported to be 755 MPa, and the fatigue endurance limit was
                    412.5 MPa31.

                    The type A miniscrew had a shaft length of 5.5 mm (the pitch and depth of a traditional thread with
                    a buttress reverse thread shape), with a taper of 1.30°. Micro-computed tomographic (CT) images were
                    acquired with a cubic voxel of 5 μm3, and serial images of 845 consecutive slices were used to
                    reconstruct the 3-D surface model using a CT modeler (Toshiba IT & Control Systems Co., Tokyo,
                    Japan); 3-D finite elemental models of the type A miniscrew were constructed from the segmental
                    images.

                    The type B miniscrew had a shaft length of 5.2 mm, a pitch of 0.5 mm, a depth of 0.2 mm, and a taper
                    of 2.0°. The screw thread was characterized according to a 35° proximal half angle and a 10° distal
                    half angle; 3-D FE models of the type B miniscrews were created using computer-aided design data
                    provided by BIODENT Co., Ltd.

                    The peri-implant bone model had a cylindrical shape. It consisted of cortical bone and cancellous
                    bone layers. Three peri-implant bone models were created to represent cortical bone thicknesses of
                    1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.0 mm, and cancellous bone thicknesses of 5.5 mm, 5.0 mm, and 4.0 mm,
                    respectively (Fig. 1). The miniscrew models were placed to a depth of 5.5 mm. These miniscrew models
                    were constructed to represent screw placement orientations of 0° (vertical direction) and 30°
                    (oblique direction) against the cortical bone surface (Fig. 1). Twelve models were meshed with delta
                    cone tetrahedrons representing the cortical and cancellous bones using HyperWorks software (Altair
                    Engineering, Troy, MI, USA).</p>

                    algorithm for pharyngeal airway on CBCT data using an AI software (Diagnocat) which will procure a
                    measurement method. The second aim is to validate the newly developed artificial intelligence system
                    in comparison to commercially available software for 3D CBCT evaluation. A Convolutional Neural
                    Network-based machine learning algorithm was used for the segmentation of the pharyngeal airways in
                    OSA and non-OSA patients. Radiologists used semi-automatic software to manually determine the airway
                    and their measurements were compared with the AI. OSA patients were classified as minimal, mild,
                    moderate, and severe groups, and the mean airway volumes of the groups were compared. The narrowest
                    points of the airway (mm), the field of the airway (mm2), and volume of the airway (cc) of both OSA
                    and non-OSA patients were also compared. There was no statistically significant difference between
                    the manual technique and Diagnocat measurements in all groups (p > 0.05). Inter-class correlation
                    coefficients were 0.954 for manual and automatic segmentation, 0.956 for Diagnocat and automatic
                    segmentation, 0.972 for Diagnocat and manual segmentation. Although there was no statistically
                    significant difference in total airway volume measurements between the manual measurements,
                    automatic measurements, and DC measurements in non-OSA and OSA patients, we evaluated the output
                    images to understand why the mean value for the total airway was higher in DC measurement. It was
                    seen that the DC algorithm also measures the epiglottis volume and the posterior nasal aperture
                    volume due to the low soft-tissue contrast in CBCT images and that leads to higher values in airway
                    volume measurement.

                </p>


                <p class="mb-4-lg-7"><b>Approach</b> To handle large volume sizes on a reasonably fine scale, we
                    approach this task with a coarse-to-fine approach. In general, a coarse-to-fine framework performs
                    an inference at successively finer scales. The approach uses the results from the previous coarser
                    stages to guide and speed up inference at the finer stages. A coarse-to-fine framework allows to
                    achieve high-quality segmentation masks while being efficient during inference.

                    In this model, we use a two-stage coarse-to-fine approach. Both stages are defined as semantic
                    segmentation tasks but at different voxel scales. At the first (coarse) stage, the whole volume is
                    analyzed at once in a single forward pass through the neural network. During this stage, the model
                    operates in coarse resolution of scale 1 mm. The goal of this stage is to perform a coarse
                    segmentation of anatomical structures in a computationally efficient manner. </p>

                <p class="mb-5"><b>Materials and methods:</b>
                    Four electronic boards with temperature sensors were encapsulated in mouthguards made from
                    ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The error and time to reach steady-state temperature were determined
                    using a thermostatic water bath during three different conditions (34, 38.5 and 43 °C).
                    Subsequently, a case study of one volunteer wearing the instrumented mouthguard is presented. </p>
                <p class="mb-4-lg-7"><b>Results:</b> The water bath tests showed that a mean absolute error of 0.2 °C
                    was reached after a maximum of 690 s across all test conditions. The case study yielded an absolute
                    error was 0.2 °C after 1110 s.</p>
                <p class="mb-4-lg-7"><b>Conclusions:</b>These results show that an instrumented mouthguard with
                    temperature sensing capabilities can yield a consistent steady-state error that is close to the
                    clinical requirements across a range of temperatures. However, the time it takes to reach
                    steady-state temperature needs to be considered for these systems to correctly interpret the
                    outcomes. </p>
